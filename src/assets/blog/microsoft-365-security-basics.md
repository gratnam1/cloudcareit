# Microsoft 365 Security Basics: MFA, Phishing, and Backups

Most small-business incidents start with a stolen password or a phishing email.

## The practical checklist
1. Turn on **MFA** for all users (non‑negotiable)
2. Use **conditional access** if available (or at least block legacy auth)
3. Configure **spam/phishing protections**
4. Make sure your **backup strategy** covers the data you care about (mail, OneDrive, SharePoint)
5. Train staff on **phishing red flags**

## Quick win
If you do only one thing: **enable MFA** and remove old sign‑in methods.
