# For Google Reviews to work:
# 1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable "Places API" and "Places API (New)".
# 2. Create an API key and restrict it to Places API.
# 3. Copy this file to .env.local and set GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY and GOOGLE_PLACE_ID.
# 4. Run the app with the Node server (e.g. npm run build && npm run serve:ssr:cloudcare-frontend).
#    The /api/google-reviews endpoint is only available when the server is running.
