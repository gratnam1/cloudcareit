# Managed IT vs Break/Fix: What Small Businesses Really Pay

Most small businesses start with **break/fix** (call IT only when something breaks). It feels cheaper—until downtime, security incidents, and constant fire-fighting become normal.

## The simple difference
- **Break/Fix:** reactive, unpredictable costs, issues repeat
- **Managed IT:** proactive monitoring + maintenance, predictable monthly cost

## What typically costs more (in real life)
- Downtime (staff waiting)
- Email lockouts / account takeover
- Ransomware recovery
- Emergency after-hours support

## When managed IT becomes the better deal
If you have **5+ users** and rely on Microsoft 365, shared files, and stable Wi‑Fi, managed IT usually wins because it prevents recurring problems.
