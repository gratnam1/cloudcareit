# Why Office Wi‑Fi Gets Slow (and how to fix it)

Slow Wi‑Fi usually comes from a few common issues—not “bad internet”.

## Top causes
- Access points placed poorly (coverage gaps)
- Too many devices on one AP
- Old routers doing double‑NAT
- No separation between guest + staff devices
- Interference from neighboring networks

## Fast fixes that work
- Add/relocate access points (coverage first)
- Separate guest Wi‑Fi from business devices
- Upgrade to business-grade APs + controller (when needed)
- Tune channels and power levels

If your team depends on Wi‑Fi to work, it’s worth making it stable and predictable.
